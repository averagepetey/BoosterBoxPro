## Mobile Optimization Checklist

### For Each Section:
- [ ] **Layout:** Test on mobile (< 640px) - does it stack properly?
- [ ] **Text:** Is all text readable without zooming? (minimum 14px body)
- [ ] **CTAs:** Are buttons large enough to tap easily? (minimum 44px height)
- [ ] **Spacing:** Is there adequate space between interactive elements?
- [ ] **Images:** Do images scale properly and load quickly?
- [ ] **Navigation:** Is navigation accessible and easy to use?
- [ ] **Performance:** Does the section load quickly on mobile?
- [ ] **Touch Targets:** Are all clickable elements at least 44px?
- [ ] **Scrolling:** Is content easy to scroll through?
- [ ] **Visual Hierarchy:** Is the most important content visible first?

### Mobile-Specific Considerations:
- **Hero Section:** 
  - Mobile: Stack marketing content above data feed
  - Ensure CTAs are prominent and tappable
  - Simplify data cards for mobile viewing
- **Chrome Extension:**
  - Mobile: Show simplified mockup or illustration
  - Emphasize mobile browser compatibility (if applicable)
- **Testimonials:**
  - Mobile: Single card view with swipe gestures
  - Larger profile pictures and text
- **Data Grid:**

  - Larger icons and clearer hierarchy

  - Larger buttons, clear pricing display

## Notes

- **Mobile optimization is EQUALLY important as web optimization**
- All sections should be fully responsive and mobile-first
- Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools
- Follow existing design system (dark theme, glassmorphism)
- Maintain consistency with dashboard styling
- Focus on conversion: clear CTAs, value proposition, social proof
- **Mobile-first approach:** Design for mobile first, then enhance for desktop
- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) throughout
- Ensure all interactive elements work with touch gestures
