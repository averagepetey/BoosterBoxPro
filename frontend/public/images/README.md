# Logo Directory

Place your logo file here:

- **File name**: `logo.png`
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Description**: Red rocket boot with orange/yellow flames
- **Recommended size**: 512x512px or larger (will be scaled as needed)

The logo will be used in:
- Navigation bar (40-48px height)
- Landing page (120-160px height)
- Login/Register pages (64-80px height)
- Favicon (will be generated from this file)

Once you add `logo.png` to this directory, it will automatically be used throughout the application.
